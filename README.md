# map

Hey, this is my hobby project where I wrote some python code which performs a [polyhedral projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_map_projection) to create my "own" Butterfly:

This code is capable of projecting even larger basemaps from equirectangular to your own polyhedral projection. For details, check the [manual](./doc/maunual.md).
